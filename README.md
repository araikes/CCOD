Comprehensive Concussion Outcomes Database

The purpose of the Comprehensive Concussion Outcomes Database is curate a database of concussion/mild traumatic brain injury-related outcomes for facilitating systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

As of the first release of the database (10/23/17), the database is exclusively tied to a manuscript looking at the prevalence of the reporting of race, ethnicity, country of origin, and language distributions in neurocognitive outcomes research.

The ultimate goal is to have and maintain a comprehensive database along with online visualization and downloadable Bibtex and plain text reference lists to enable easier literature searching, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses.
