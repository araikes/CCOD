#### Header Information ####
# This is the initializing script file for the CCOD database. It is the first
# effort to make certain that the data is accessible from the REDCap API. It may
# also serve as the backbone of the initial article, which will be the Race,
# Ethnicity, CoO, and Language Demographic Review.

# Author: Adam Raikes
# Initial Date: 06/08/2017

#### Call REDCap API ####
# As this repository is public, the API key should be pasted into this spot when
# run and then removed so that it is not persistently available.
